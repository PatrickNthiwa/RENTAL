#The parts of MVC
Model: Model code typically reflects real-world things. This code can hold raw data, or it will define the essential components of the app. 
#The model code would define what a “task” is.It contains the classes that would communicate with the database.
#View: View code is made up of all the functions that directly interact with the user like forms. This is the code that makes the app look nice, and otherwise defines how your user sees and interacts with it.
#Controller: Controller code acts as a liaison between the Model and the View, receiving user input and deciding what to do with it. It’s the brains of the application, and ties together the model and the view.
